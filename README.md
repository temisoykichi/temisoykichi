# Building, Breaking, and Rebuilding  

Technology is all about evolution. I don’t just write code—I design systems, solve problems, and challenge assumptions. Whether it’s architecting scalable software, experimenting with emerging technologies, or optimizing performance, I focus on creating solutions that matter.  

## Who I Am  
- **Systems Thinker** – I approach problems from a high level, considering scalability, efficiency, and long-term impact.  
- **Pragmatic Developer** – I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that serves real-world needs.  
- **Lifelong Learner** – Tech moves fast, and I stay ahead by constantly exploring new frameworks, languages, and methodologies.  

## What I Do  
- **Software Engineering** – Building robust, scalable applications that solve complex problems.  
- **Distributed Systems & Cloud** – Designing architectures that handle real-world loads and reliability challenges.  
- **Performance Optimization** – Fine-tuning applications to be faster, leaner, and more efficient.  

## Looking for  
- **Challenging Problems** – The harder, the better. I enjoy solving issues that push the limits of what's possible.  
- **Collaborative Teams** – I thrive in environments where people challenge each other to do better.  
- **Purpose-Driven Projects** – Work that has a tangible impact, whether in tech, business, or society.
